I'm learning to code, don't laugh :)

// Goal

The Test.ino program runs on my Seeed Xiao board, this program controls the board's LED with nRFConnect app.
But this board can also read an analog voltage between 0 and 3.3V. 
I'd like to create a program called YachApp.ino, which would retrieve this input voltage and display this value in the StarboardSensor.js page with the circular progress bar between 0 and 3.3V and display the value below instead of the value in kgs. 
I'd also like to add a button to Sensors.js to enable BLE scanning and connection. I'd also like to see a button on StarboardSensor.js that lets you measure the analog value when you click on it. 
If possible, below this button, record previous measurements to keep a history of the measurements taken. 
The application would have to be downloadable on Android and iOS, and the communication would have to be as reliable as possible.

I'm completely free if you need more info and I'd like to do a progress review over the phone after 2 hours of work to make sure we're moving in the right direction.
